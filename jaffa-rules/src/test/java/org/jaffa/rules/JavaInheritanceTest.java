/**
 * Results of Java Inheritance tests
 * 1 - The rules bound to the constructor of a parent class is not fired on creation of a child instance.
 * 2 - The rules for a child class cannnot be bound to a method, if that method doesn't exist on the child class, and hence will be ignored. The corresponding rules for the parent class will however be invoked.
 * 3 - The rules for a child class will be invoked, if the method is coded in the child class. The rules for the parent class will not be invoked, if the corresponding 'super' method is not invoked by the child.
 * 4 - The interceptor-stack passed while executing the rules for the child class is different from the interceptor-stack passed while executing the rules for the corresponding 'super' method. For example, this would result in the evaluation of the CaseType rule for both a child and a parent, even though the CaseTypePropertyRule is coded to perform case-conversion only once !!
 * 5 - The labels for the parent class are not inherited by a child class.
